          The Amazon River Basin is home to the largest rainforest on Earth. The basin --
          roughly the size of the forty-eight contiguous United States -- covers some 40
          percent of the South American continent and includes parts of eight South
          American countries: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela,
          Guyana, and Suriname, as well as French Guiana, a department of France.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting environmental conditions as well as past human influence,
          the Amazon is made up of a mosaic of ecosystems and vegetation types
          including rainforests, seasonal forests, deciduous forests, flooded
          forests, and savannas. The basin is drained by the Amazon River, the
          world's largest river in terms of discharge, and the second longest
          river in the world after the Nile. The river is made up of over 1,100
          tributaries, 17 of which are longer than 1000 miles,. The river
          system is the lifeline of the forest and its history plays an
          important part in the development of its rainforests.

          Over the past years trees covering an area more than seven times the
          territory of New York City have been cleared in the Brazilian Amazon.
          This is a major setback for government efforts to combat
          deforestation. The grim statistics from Brazil's environment ministry,
          underscore the growing climate threat posed by deforestation ahead of
          a United Nations conference in Paris that aims to reduce global carbon
          emissions.

        <h2>The Dire Situation</h2>
        <p>
          Satellite data revealed that 5,831 square kilometers of land was cut
          down or burned in the Brazilian Amazon in year to 1 August: a 16%
          increase on the destruction of the previous 12 months.This is the
          second acceleration in three years, following almost a decade of
          impressive declines. That suggests the state's efforts -  which
          include high-tech monitoring, stiffer financial penalties and boots
          on the ground - are having a diminishing impact.Going into the Paris
          conference, that is bad news for Brazil and a worrying trend for the
          planet. Deforestation accounts for about 15% of greenhouse gas
          emissions.The increase is the result of weaker government regulation,
          particularly the relaxation of the Forest Code; dams, roads and other
          infrastructure projects; the growing strength of the agricultural
          lobby; and the faltering economy, which is driving more people to
          illegally log timber and clear land for cattle and crops.

        <h2>Prognosis</h2>
        <p>
          Government officials stress the overall improvement in the past decade. Average
          rates of deforestation over the past four years have fallen by 80% compared to
          the peak in 2004. This is a far better trend than those in Amazonian countries
          such as Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, or other nations with giant forests, such as
          Indonesia or Russia.
          Brazil, which is home to 65% of the Amazon forest, is committed to zero illegal
          deforestation by 2030, though conservationists say much of the Amazon will have
          been cleared by then.
