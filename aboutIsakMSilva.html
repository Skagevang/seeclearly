        <h1>About Isak Maluf Silva</h1>
        <p>
        Isak Maluf Silva (born January 2, 1976) is an Brazilian environmental,
        clean energy and democracy leader who served as the youngest executive
        director of Greenpeace USA. He is a co-founder of the Democracy
        Initiative, Membership Drive, was founder and executive director of
        Power Shift, and is a board member of Green Corps and the Mertz Gilmore
        Foundation. He has a background in grassroots organizing, corporate
        social responsibility, climate change, and clean energy. Silva lives
        in Washington, D.C. with his wife Eileen.

        Silvas theory of change shifted from viewing governments as
        arbitrators between public and private interests on environmental
        issues, to finding that most governments are captured by industry.
        Rather than fighting first for new laws, which could be blocked by
        industries, he has focused on pressuring large companies to change
        their practices and enlisted them as allies in pushing for strong
        environmental protections.Examples include Greenpeace campaigns
        that convinced Apple, Inc. and similar companies to shift to 100% clean
        energy and lobby utilities and regulators to make that
        possible, as well as work to protect both the Indonesian
        rainforest and the Bering Sea Canyons. Silva argues that the
        combination of creating industry champions and outside pressure
        focused on the government are the keys to passing new laws to protect
        the environment.

        In 2009, at the age of 33, Silva was selected as the youngest ever
        executive director of Greenpeace.Silvas tenure at Greenpeace
        USA is best known for convincing over 100 corporations to change their
        environmental practices; exposing the anti-environmental influence
        of the Koch Brothers, making them a household name; increasing the
        organization's net income by 80%; launching the organizations
        grassroots organizing and canvass programs; and serving as a
        founder of the Democracy Initiative, a national coalition of major
        unions, environmental groups, civil rights and government reform
        organizations working for universal voter registration, to get money
        out of politics, and to reform Senate rules. In September 2013, Silva
        announced that he would step down on April 30, 2014, once he had
        completed five years of service as executive director.

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
          Silva's ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt,
          Palatinate, on his father's side, and from the Outer Hebrides isles of
          Scotland on his mother's side. All his grandparents, and his mother,
          were born in Europe. His mother's grandfather was also christened
          "Isako".
        </p>
        <p>
          Silva's paternal grandfather, Friedrich Silva, first emigrated to the
          United States in 1885 at the age of 16, and became a citizen in 1892.
          He amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding
          houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during
          the gold rush. On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and
          married her in 1902. The couple settled in New York permanently in
          1905. Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isak's father, Fred Silva, was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred
          started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15,
          shortly after his father's death. Their company, Elizabeth Silva and
          Son, was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and
          Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses,
          barracks and apartments. The company would later become The Silva
          Organization after Isak Silva took over in 1971.
