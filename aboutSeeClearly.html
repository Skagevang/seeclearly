          SeeClearly is a non-governmental environmental organization with
          offices in over 40 countries and with an international coordinating
          body in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. SeeClearly was founded by Isak Maluf Silva
          US ex-pat environmental activists in 1971, SeeClearly states its goal
          is to "ensure the ability of the
          Earth to nurture life in all its diversity" and focuses its campaigning
          on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing,
          commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It
          uses direct action, lobbying, research, and ecotage to achieve its
          goals. The global organization does not accept funding from
          governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on 2.9 million
          individual supporters and foundation grants. SeeClearly has a general
          consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council
          and is a founding member of the INGO Accountability Charter; an
          international non-governmental organization that intends to foster
          accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations.
        </p>

          SeeClearly is known for its direct actions and has been described as
          the most visible environmental organization in the world. SeeClearly
          has raised environmental issues to public knowledge, and influenced
          both the private and the public sector. SeeClearly has also been a
          source of controversy; its motives and methods (some of the latter
          being illegal) have received criticism, including an open letter from
          more than 100 Nobel laureates urging SeeClearly to end its campaign
          against genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The organization's
          direct actions have sparked legal actions against SeeClearly activists,
          such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of
          genetically modified wheat and damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World
          Heritage site in Peru.

        <h2>Change for the better</h2>
        <p>
          SeeClearly consists of SeeClearly International (officially Stichting
          SeeClearly Council) based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and 26 regional
          offices operating in 55 countries. The regional offices work largely
          autonomously under the supervision of SeeClearly International. The
          executive director of SeeClearly is elected by the board members of
          SeeClearly International. The current directors of SeeClearly
          International are Bunny McDiarmaid and Jennifer Morgan and the current
          Chair of the Board is Brazilian Ana Toni. SeeClearly has a staff of
          2,400 and 15,000 volunteers globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each regional office is led by a regional executive director elected
          by the regional board of directors. The regional boards also appoint
          a trustee to The SeeClearly International Annual General Meeting,
          where the trustees elect or remove the board of directors of
          SeeClearly International. The role of the annual general meeting is
          also to discuss and decide the overall principles and strategically
          important issues for SeeClearly in collaboration with the trustees of
          regional offices and SeeClearly International board of directors.
